\title{Use of variable window and minimizer sizes on inexact pattern matching}
\author{Arthur Latache}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Currently, to read DNA we need an heuristic, and one of the most used is finding a substring that represents a window(calling them minimizers), and checking where it occurs in the main pattern, and then matching with a more costly algorithm. To find a the minimizer of a window they need two parameters: window size and substring size, nowadays due to current algorithms, these parameters are fixed in size. So we will study the possibility and advantages of using these parameters with a variable value. To evaluate the we results we did ...
